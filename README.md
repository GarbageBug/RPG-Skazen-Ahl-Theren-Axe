Skazen-Ahl-Theren-Axe
The City of Drenathor 
Captain of the watch ran arena under the 'Manor House' pitting species against species as long as they are not human....

Captain is slain, by non-humans in the dark of the night

Magister (Felfor) in Drenethor is some help
The Governess (the sister of the Baron) and new 'Captian/City Leader' of Drenathor is no help, but not a hindrance either...she is short, curt and to the point

Trail leads to the Violet Woods/glade then leads to the Burning Caverns (maybe it is Burning Glad>Violet Caverns

Jaraxe, sent some thugs to intercept the party as a test; IF the Party runs this tanget Go To git@github.com:GarbageBug/rpg-the-haunted-lake.git

Fili=crude map
Kili=Journal (solves the cypher)
Ember=Cypher (cyper explains the map)

You end up searching for 'The Captain' who is NOT the murdered Captain of the Watch in Drenethor;
But rather an old sea captain who holds one of the few copies of the "Trials of Skazen-Ahl-Theren-Axe"

The Captain (Jerhold Thornbrow) can be found in the port town of 'Scarsfold', retired captain of the Potter's Mouth (masthead of beggar woman with hand out as if begging) merchant ship
He will spin a yarn about the Mermen of the Eastern Sea's and how they were the last keepers of Skazen-Ahl-Theren-Axe; but in reality he is yarnster and has another portion of crude map that can be added to the original. 
With the second piece of the map it becomes clear there is yet a third piece to the map.  Jerhold Thornbrow will point the party in the direction of The Temple of the Cliff.

The Temple of the Cliff is a Temple to Umberlee used to pray for safe passage and all that good stuff.  The Priest of Umberlee there is a former crew member of the Potter's Mouth and sailed with the ill fated Captain of Drenathor.
