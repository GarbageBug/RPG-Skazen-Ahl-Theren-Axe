Skazen-Alltherenaxe
The City of Drenathor 
Captain of the watch ran arena under the 'Manor House' pitting species against species as long as they are not human....

Captain is slain, by non-humans in the dark of the night

Magister in Drenethor is some help, new governess of Drenathor is no help, but not a hindrance either...she is short, curt and to the point

Trail leads to the Violet Woods/glade then leads to the Burning Caverns (maybe it is Burning Glad>Violet Caverns

you end up searching for 'The Captain' who is NOT the murdered Captain of the Watch in Drenethor;
But rather an old sea captain who holds one of the few copies of the "Trials of Skazen Alltherenaxe"

The Captain (Jerhold Thornbrow) can be found in the port town of 'Scarsfold'
